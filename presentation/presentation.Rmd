### Finding an Ad Popularity Metric

```{r likes-vs-views, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = 'center'}
youtube %>%
  filter(like_count < 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = view_count, y = like_count)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Number of Views",
       y = "Number of Likes",
       title = "The Relationship Between Youtube Video Likes and Views") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "orange")

likes_views_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(like_count ~ view_count, data = youtube)

```

.footnote[

### Rationalizing our Ad Popularity Metric

* The regression equation is as follows:

* $\hat{like count_i} = 1883.826 + 0.001727871 * view count_i$

* To avoid comparing raw view or like counts across Youtube videos of Super Bowl ads, we decided to define an ad popularity variable likes/view

* According to this metric, which video do you think is more "popular"?

### Is it Worth it for Brands to Post Their Ads on Their Official Youtube Channels?

```{r channel-type-bar-plot, echo= FALSE, fig.align= 'center', out.width= "60%"}

       y = "Average Ad Popularity",
       fill = "Channel Type") 
```

.footnote[

### Limitations of the Dataset

* Ad categories are evaluated as True or False as opposed to on a continuum to allow for an analysis of the effect of 
a given category's increasing presence.

* Dataset of Youtube video observations as opposed to real responses to ads that aired during the Super Bowl creates a 
disconnect between what's popular during the Super Bowl and who goes to watch videos on Youtube after the event.

---

### Suggested Next Steps

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height= 350, out.width = 650, fig.align='left'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/football.jpeg")

```
]

.pull-right[
* Evaluate Youtube videos with better category choices (i.e. music, emotion, brand popularity, celebrity status)

* Use data driven by a survey rather than Youtube engagement to accurately estimate ad popularity in real time rather 
than those who choose to view Youtube ads.
