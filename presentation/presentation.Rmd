## Finding an Ad Popularity Metric

```{r likes-vs-views, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = 'center'}
youtube %>%
  filter(like_count < 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = view_count, y = like_count)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Number of Views",
       y = "Number of Likes",
       title = "The Relationship Between Youtube Video Likes and Views") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "orange")

likes_views_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(like_count ~ view_count, data = youtube)

```


---

## Rationalizing our Ad Popularity Metric

* To avoid comparing raw view or like counts across Youtube videos of Super Bowl ads, we decided to define an ad popularity variable likes/view

* According to this metric, which video do you think is more "popular"?

## How do ad categories influence an ad's popularity?

.pull-center[

``` {r violin-plot-funny, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
youtube %>%
  filter(title != "Frank the Monkey Bud Light") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = funny,

  labs(title = "Ad Popularity of Funny Vs. Not Funny Ads",
       x = "Funny Ad Category",
       y = "Ad Popularity")

## How do ad categories influence an ad's popularity?
 
.pull-center[

``` {r violin-plot-patriotic, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}

youtube %>%
  filter(title != "Frank the Monkey Bud Light") %>%

  labs(title = "Ad Popularity of Patriotic Vs. Non-Patriotic Ads",
       x = "Patriotic Ad Category",
       y = "Ad Popularity")
```

## How do different brands influence an ad's popularity?

```{r popularity-by-brand, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center', warning = FALSE}
youtube %>%
  mutate(likes_per_view = youtube$like_count/youtube$view_count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = likes_per_view, color = brand)) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~brand, ncol = 5) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Ad Popularity (Likes per View)",
       title = "The Popularity of Superbowl Ad Youtube Videos by Brand")
```

## How has ad production changed over time by brand?


```{r brand-streamgraph, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
brand_counts <- youtube %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise("Toyota" = sum(brand == "Toyota", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Doritos" = sum(brand == "Doritos", na.rm = TRUE), 
            "E-Trade" = sum(brand == "E-Trade", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Budweiser" = sum(brand == "Budweiser", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Bud Light" = sum(brand == "Bud Light", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Pepsi" = sum(brand == "Pepsi", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Coca Cola" = sum(brand == "Coca-Cola", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Hyundai" = sum(brand == "Hyundai", na.rm = TRUE),
            "Kia" = sum(brand == "Kia", na.rm = TRUE),
            "NFL" = sum(brand == "NFL", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -year, values_to = "count", names_to = "type") 

brand_ad_production <- streamgraph(brand_counts, key = "type", value = "count", date = "year", height="300px", width="1000px")
brand_ad_production 
```

---

## How has ad production changed over time by ad category?


```{r category-streamgraph, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
ad_counts <- youtube %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise("Funny" = sum(funny, na.rm = TRUE),
            "Show Product Quickly" = sum(show_product_quickly, na.rm = TRUE), 
            "Patriotic" = sum(patriotic, na.rm = TRUE),
            "Celebrity" = sum(celebrity, na.rm = TRUE),
            "Danger" = sum(danger, na.rm = TRUE),
            "Animals" = sum(animals, na.rm = TRUE),
            "Use Sex" = sum(use_sex, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -year, values_to = "count", names_to = "type")

pp <- streamgraph(ad_counts, key = "type", value = "count", date = "year", height="300px", width="1000px")
pp
```

#What context can inform the trends in ad production?


  * Presidential Elections (2008, 2016, 2020)
  
--

  * Social/Political movements (Me Too Movement in 2017)

## Is it worth it for brands to post their ads on their official Youtube channels?

```{r channel-type-bar-plot, echo= FALSE, fig.align= 'center', out.width= "70%"}
youtube %>%
  group_by(official) %>%
  summarise(avg_ad_popularity = mean(ad_popularity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = official, y = avg_ad_popularity, fill = official)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CE2029", "#0055B3")) +
  labs(title = "Average Ad Popularity by Channel Type",
       x = "Channel Type",
       y = "Average Ad Popularity",
       fill = "Channel Type") 
```

---

## Limitations of the Dataset

* Ad categories are evaluated as True or False as opposed to on a continuum to allow for an analysis of the effect of 
a given category's increasing presence.

* Dataset of Youtube video observations as opposed to real responses to ads that aired during the Super Bowl creates a 
disconnect between what's popular during the Super Bowl and who goes to watch videos on Youtube after the event.

---

## Suggested next steps

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height= 350, out.width = 650, fig.align='left'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/football.jpeg")

```
]

.pull-right[
* Evaluate Youtube videos with better category choices (i.e. music, emotion, brand popularity, celebrity status)

* Use data driven by a survey rather than Youtube engagement to accurately estimate ad popularity in real time rather 
than those who choose to view Youtube ads.
