* To avoid comparing raw view or like counts across Youtube videos of Super Bowl ads, we decided to define an ad popularity variable likes/view

* According to this metric, which video do you think is more "popular"?

### Limitations of the Dataset

* Ad categories are evaluated as True or False as opposed to on a continuum to allow for an analysis of the effect of 
a given category's increasing presence.

* Dataset of Youtube video observations as opposed to real responses to ads that aired during the Super Bowl creates a 
disconnect between what's popular during the Super Bowl and who goes to watch videos on Youtube after the event.

### Suggested Next Steps

]

.pull-right[
* Evaluate Youtube videos with better category choices (i.e. music, emotion, brand popularity, celebrity status)

* Use data driven by a survey rather than Youtube engagement to accurately estimate ad popularity in real time rather 
than those who choose to view Youtube ads.
