# Lessons to be Learned from Super Bowl Advertisements

## Why is the Super Bowl such a big deal for brands?

* The 2021 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Tampa Bay Buccaneers emerge victorious against the Kansas City Chiefs was watched by 91.63 million viewers in the United States

--

* Clear that the Super Bowl has an extremely high viewership, ads that air reach a huge number of people and is thus an opportunity for brands to build reputation and revenue

--
* Brands heavily invest into their ads because there is evidence that supports the fact that more viewership leads to more consumption of the branded product. They use their ads to build complementary relationship between the brand and sports viewership more broadly.

---

## A little about our data

* We used Superbowl ad data from the past 20 years to analyze trends in ad popularity and production. 

--

* The data comes from FiveThirtyEight, who published a corresponding article "According to Superbowl Ads, Americans Love America, Animals and Sex" in February, 2021. 

--

* The data was collected by watching and evaluating 233 ads on Youtube from the 10 brands that aired the most in the last 21 Super Bowls (according to Superbowl-ads.com) using seven criteria.

---
## How does Youtube video engagement inform ad popularity?

* Can we predict what will make a Super Bowl ad published on Youtube more popular than another?

--

How can we measure ad popularity from our dataset?

---

## How can we define an ad popularity metric?

* To avoid comparing raw view or like counts across Youtube videos of Super Bowl ads, we decided to define an ad popularity variable likes/view

--

* According to this metric, which video do you think is more "popular"?

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Sepal.Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Sepal.Width &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Petal.Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Petal.Width &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Species &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &amp;#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders `\(\alpha+\beta\)`. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

`$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$`

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
