#What context can inform the trends in ad production?


  * Presidential Elections (2008, 2016, 2020)
  
--

  * Social/Political movements (Me Too Movement in 2017)
  
---

## Is it worth it for brands to post their ads on their official Youtube channels?

&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/channel-type-bar-plot-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Limitations of the Dataset

* Ad categories are evaluated as True or False as opposed to on a continuum to allow for an analysis of the effect of 
a given category's increasing presence.

* Dataset of Youtube video observations as opposed to real responses to ads that aired during the Super Bowl creates a 
disconnect between what's popular during the Super Bowl and who goes to watch videos on Youtube after the event.

## Suggested next steps

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="img/football.jpeg" width="650" height="350" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
* Evaluate Youtube videos with better category choices (i.e. music, emotion, brand popularity, celebrity status)
